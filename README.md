# Android-Music-App-Beta
Play music automatically when headphones are plugged in. Type of music will be based on preferences movement level.

This app will run in the background, at all times. 
The app will constantly be checking on whether headphones are plugged in or not. 
If they are, music immediately plays based on settings.
Opening the app would just be used to change settings, only a very basic ui is needed.

SETTINGS 
option 1 - shuffle mode 
option 2 - map playlists to activity level 
option 3 - disable/enable

OPTION 1: Maybe as a beta version, this will just select random songs to play, from your whole library. 
We could later make this smarter by using machine learning. 
The idea behind this is that as a user listens to more music, data will be collected on activity level, genre of music, and length of time listening to each genre.
A learning algorithm can adjust differently for each user, and predict what the user wants, based on their unique data.
So if a user listens to metal when working out, but rap when they sit down, the learning algorithm would detect the strength of that relationship, and play music accordingly.
The algorithm gets "smarter" as more data is collected, because the relationships between activity level and genre should be more defined.

OPTION 2: Give 2 different activity levels, working out, or stationary. 
Allow user to set a playlist for each activity level, and play random songs within the appropriate playlists. 
Playlists will automatically be toggled back and forth as activity level changes.

OPTION 3: Disable or re-enable the app.
